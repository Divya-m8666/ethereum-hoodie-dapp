#  Ethereum Hoodie DApp  
A simple decentralized application (DApp) that connects to MetaMask and interacts with a smart contract deployed on the **Ethereum Hoodie Network** (a custom local blockchain).

This project demonstrates:

- MetaMask wallet connection  
- Reading and writing values from a smart contract  
- Using ethers.js  
- Deploying contracts on a custom RPC network  
- Local blockchain setup with Ganache  

---

##  Features

- Connect MetaMask wallet  
- Retrieve stored value from contract  
- Store new value into contract  
- Runs on your custom network **"Ethereum Hoodie"**  
- Clean UI built with HTML + CSS  
- JavaScript interaction using ethers.js

##  Requirements

Before running the DApp, make sure you have:

- MetaMask installed  
- Ganache running (for "Ethereum Hoodie" private network)  
- A deployed smart contract with ABI and contract address  
- Contract address updated inside `script.js`  

---

##  Setting Up "Ethereum Hoodie" Network

1. Open **MetaMask → Settings → Networks → Add Network**
2. Enter:

Network Name: Ethereum Hoodie
RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:7545

Chain ID: 1337
Currency Symbol: HOOD

Save network.

3. Import Ganache account:
   - Copy private key from Ganache
   - Open MetaMask → Import Account → Paste key

You now have 100 HOOD tokens.

##  Deploy Smart Contract (Remix)

1. Open https://remix.ethereum.org  
2. Set ENVIRONMENT → Injected Provider – MetaMask  
3. Make sure MetaMask is on **Ethereum Hoodie**  
4. Deploy contract  
5. Copy the contract address  
6. Paste the address inside `script.js`:

```javascript
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE";
Run the DApp

Open the project folder in VS Code

Right-click index.html

Select Open With Live Server

Website will open at:
http://127.0.0.1:5500/dapp/index.html
Click Connect Wallet

You can now interact with your smart contract!

Smart Contract (Example)
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract HoodieStorage {
    uint256 value;

    function setValue(uint256 _value) public {
        value = _value;
    }

    function getValue() public view returns (uint256) {
        return value;
    }
}
